        <center><h2>Statement of Purpose</h2></center><br>
<p align="justify">This significant component of your application package to a foreign institution should convey in a lucid style what you intend to gain from undergoing the program. It should logically and convincingly explain why you seek admission to the program in the University/Institution. The statement should cover the basic details about your background, interests, achievements, capabilities, career objectives, dreams and future plans. It should be prepared thoughtfully. At any stage, if a question is raised by the admitting authority on any of the points, you should be able to answer it with confidence and clarity, in an honest manner.

Each applicant must submit a statement of purpose. The statement of purpose is your opportunity
to help reviewers better understand your academic objectives and determine if you are a good
match for the field to which you are applying.
Length and Format:
The statement should be one or two pages. Include your full name and the proposed field of
study at the top of each page. Please use a standard font and font size for ease of reading.</p>



</div>
      
      <div id="section2">
<center><h2>Writing the Statement of Purpose</h2><br>
<img src="img/stat.jpg" class="img-responsive"  height="100px" width="1200px"> </center><br><br>
The statement of purpose should convince the faculty on the selection committee– that you have solid achievements behind you that show promise for your success in graduate study. Think of the statement of purpose as a composition with four different parts.

Part 1: Introduce yourself, your interests and motivations
Tell them what you’re interested in, and perhaps, what sparked your desire for graduate study. This should be short and to the point; don’t spend a great deal of time on autobiography.
<br>
Part 2: Summarize your undergraduate and previous graduate career
a) Research you conducted. Indicate with whom, the title of the project, what your
responsibilities were, and the outcome. Write technically, or in the style of your discipline.
Professors are the people who read these statements.
b) Important paper or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your
curricular requirements.
c) Work experience, especially if you had any kind of responsibility for testing, designing,
researching or interning in an area similar to what you wish to study in graduate school.
<br>
Part 3: Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities
If you graduated and worked prior to returning to grad school, indicate what you’ve been doing:
company or non-profit, your work/design team, responsibilities, what you learned. You can also
indicate here how this helped you focus your graduate studies.
<br>
Part 4: Elaborate on your academic interests
Here you indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince
the faculty that you understand the scope of research in their discipline, and are engaged with
current research themes.
a) Indicate the area of your interests. Ideally, pose a question, define a problem, or indicate a
theme that you would like to address, and questions that arise from contemporary research. This
should be an ample paragraph!
b) Look on the web for information about departments you’re interested in, including professors
and their research. Are there professors whose research interests parallel yours? If so, indicate
this. Check the specific program; many may require you to name a professor or professors with
whom you might work.
c) End your statement in a positive manner, indicating your excitement and readiness for the
challenges ahead of you.

<h5>The following advice is another
friendly measure in helping you write that winning essay: </h5>
<br>
<ul id="advice"><li>
 Word Count, Number of Pages & Format (spacing, margins, font size, etc.)</li>
<li>Examine samples written by other students who have submitted successful
letters of intent. This will help you get a better understanding of the format.
Of course, please do not copy their work. Write your own letter of intent.</li>
<li>Write a first draft. Read the questions again. Make sure that you have
effectively answered the questions provided by the institution.</li>
<li>Ask a professor, counselor or someone that you trust to read your first draft
and provide any feedback on its content.</li>
<li>Once you have received adequate feedback, make the necessary changes
to your essay and prepare your final draft. The final draft should
contain strong sentence variety and be free of spelling and
grammatical errors.</li>
<li> Make sure that you have established your voice in your final draft. Your
tone in the essay should reflect what is special, diverse, unique, or
impressive about you.</li>
<li> Save! Save! Save! Be sure to keep a backup file of your document. A
portion of this essay may be useful for writing another letter of intent to
another college or university. You definitely do not want to submit the same
essay when applying to multiple schools.</li>

<center><h2>Letter of Recommendation</h2><br></center>

<p>Letter of Recommendation (LoR) helps the admission committee know about your technical, academic and non-academic expertise through your recommender. The content in the recommendation is extremely important. So, choose your recommenders wisely. There are certain areas on which the universities expect you to be rated by your receommender. They are as follows:</p>

</div>
<div id="section5">
  <center><h2>Guidelines for LOR</h2><br></center>
Generally, all universities expect you to give three LoRs. Moreover, a letter of recommendation should ideally be drafted by the recommender himself/herself.Now, the next question will be - what should I write in my LoR? So we enumerate the following points:<br><br>
<ul><li>
First Para: Write about your recommender’s qualification and the time since s/he knows you and is serving the institution.</li>
<li>
Second Para: Highlight your academic details under that teacher, how you have performed in his/her subject. Write marks and more importantly write it in percentage (Example: s/he stands in the top 5% of the class)</li>
<li>Third Para: This will vary from recommender to recommender. If you're taking one from the project guide, you can describe about the project and your incredible role in the same. Similar is the case with publications, presentations, internships and work experience.</li>
<li>Fourth Para: Please flaunt as much as you can in this paragraph. This is the extracurricular section, so write about all your achievements in the last three years (Event Head, worked for this and that committee, Sports, etc.)</li>
<li>Last Para: Keep it small (say 2-3 lines) and it should conclude the above points and tell the university to grant him admission along with Financial aid.</li>
<li>Bottom Left of Your Draft: Your teacher’s name, signature & stamp, qualification and his/her post in the current institution/company.</li></ul>
